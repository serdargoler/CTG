# CTG

**Background:** A major contributor to under‑five mortality is the death of children in the 1st month
of life. Intrapartum complications are one of the major causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal
cardiotocograph (CTGs) can be used as a monitoring tool to identify high‑risk women during labor.

**Aim:** The objective of this study was to study the precision of machine learning algorithm techniques
on CTG data in identifying high‑risk fetuses. 

**Methods:** CTG data of 2126 pregnant women were
obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Ten different
machine learning classification models were trained using CTG data. Sensitivity, precision, and F1
score for each class and overall accuracy of each model were obtained to predict normal, suspect,
and pathological fetal states. Model with best performance on specified metrics was then identified.
